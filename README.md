## LinkedIn Job Posting Scraping 

**Tools Used:** BeautifulSoup, Selenium, chromedriver, Python (pandas)

**Availability Check:** 2021-05-24

**About the Project:**

When I was looking for jobs on the LinkedIn job board, I found the built-in sorting system didn't provide enough functionalities to help me choose the most suitable jobs to apply to. And I was thinking to extract job descriptions from the LinkedIn platform and built my personal job boards. The first thing I need to start is collecting data from LinkedIn.

Firstly, I went to the LinkedIn API, but the provided API endpoints are very limited. So, I decided to scrape the data with BeautifulSoup and Selenium. This notebook is the demonstration of setting up an extraction pipeline for searching data analyst position in Canada. I fetched the data using a headless browser to simulate human browsing behavior, then formatted and saved the data into a pandas data frame, eventually exporting it to a CSV file.

After running the below code, we will get the following information about the job posting:

- Date
- Title
- Company Name
- Location
- Job Description
- Job Level
- Job Type
- Function
- Industry
- Job ID



**Saved Results:**
